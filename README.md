* This project demonstrates real-time object detection and distance measurement using OpenCV and Python. It captures video from a webcam, detects an object, and calculates its distance from the camera.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* NumPy

### Overview
* Adjust the known values for your specific setup:
    * KNOWN_DISTANCE: The distance (in cm) from the camera to the object for calibration.
    * KNOWN_WIDTH: The width (in cm) of the object for calibration.
* find_focal_length: Calculates the focal length of the camera.
* find_distance: Calculates the distance of an object from the camera.
* detect_object_and_calculate_distance: Detects the object in the frame, calculates its distance and size, and annotates the frame with this information.
